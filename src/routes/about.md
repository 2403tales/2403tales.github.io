## $ whoami

Hi, my name is Prakash, and I am a software developer. My primary interests are in Data Engineering and Full Stack development, however I tend to stay in touch with all aspects of software engineering.

I like to work with startups. My career started with [Aganitha](https://aganitha.com) in 2019. As of now (Sept 2022), I am working as Full Stack Data Scientist at Aganitha, and will soon be joining [Needle Digital](https://needle-digital.com) as Lead Engineer.

I like to watch thriller series and study Mathematics and Physics in my free time. I also like to read Hindi poems. रश्मिरथी (Rashmirathi) and मधुशाला (Madhushala) are my favourites (at least as of now). Ordered पंचवटी (Panchvati) to read next. Recently, I have started taking an interest in travelling and exploring local food. I mostly post about those on my Instagram (As of now, it only has one post lol)

Once in a while, I get an urge to write, and hence this blog. I am working on increasing my frequency of writing. Planning to release one blog post per week.

I am originally from Ghazipur, UP, but based in Hyderabad nowadays. Prefer WFH (more like Work From Anywhere) over office.

## Some of my favourite quotes

### General philosophy of life
[Steve Jobs: Secrets of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw)

> When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. But that’s a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is, everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.

> The minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will, you know if you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can mold it. That’s maybe the most important thing – is to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you’re just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it.

> I think that’s very important and however you learn that, once you learn it, you’ll want to change life and make it better, cause it’s kind of messed up, in a lot of ways. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.
 

### Against Conventional Wisdom

Albert Einstein (Haven't verified)

> Everyone knew it was impossible, until a fool who didn’t know came along and did it.

[ Steve Jobs: Here’s to the crazy ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z4NS2zdrZc)
> The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do

### Funny (yet deep) ones
Michael Scott
> Don't ever, for any reason, do anything, to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what, no matter where, or who, or who you are with, or where you are going, or where you've been, ever, for any reason whatsoever. 


[The Indispensable Man](https://www.appleseeds.org/Indispen-Man_Saxon.htm) by Saxon White Kessinger

> Sometime when you’re feeling important
>
> Sometime when your ego ‘s in bloom 
>
> Sometime when you take it for granted,
>
> You’re the best qualified in the room

> Sometime when you feel that your going 
>
> Would leave an unfillable hole
>
> Just follow these simple instructions
>
> And see how they humble your soul.

> Take a bucket and fill it with water
>
> Put your hand in it up to the wrist,
>
> Pull it out and the hole that’s remaining,
>
> Is a measure of how much you’ll be missed.
 
> You can splash all you wish when you enter,
>
> You may stir up the water galore,
>
> But stop, and you’ll find that in no time,
>
> It looks quite the same as before.
 
> The moral of this quaint example,
>
> Is to do just the best that you can,
>
> Be proud of yourself but remember, 
>
> There’s no indispensable man.
